Adds a few weapons for a spiced up game. Most of the weapons are balanced to fit into the stronger side of the meta, though some are weaker or stronger.
The stronger weapons are significantly rarer on floor loot. All weapons are compatalble with various attachments. Huge thank you to all who helped me
learn how to make this possible.
